# Enriching operational high-resolution ensemble forecasts with StyleGAN
A new proposal to generate ensemble forecasts enriching the AROME Ensemble Prediction System. 
The Stylegan-2 network is a well-performing GAN architecture (see the [original implementation](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2) and the [pytorch implementation](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch). The goal is to use a pretrained Stylegan-2 generator in order to enrich AROME-EPS forecasts. We do so by using the W hidden representation and existing AROME members to generate new members at a reduced numerical cost.  

The code allows to *train a GAN from scratch*, then to use *inversion* to retrieve important information from "real" (classically computed) AROME ensembles, and *perturbation* to generate new, randomly perturbed ensembles. Additionally, a *tuning* procedure allows to control the intensity of the perturbation.

Most of the core code for GAN training is taken as is from [Rosinality's stylegan2-pytorch github page](https://github.com/rosinality/stylegan2-pytorch) and adapted to run on Meteo France clusters.

# Installing

Run a conda / docker environment with pytorch==2.1.0.
Then make sure `ninja` is installed (in order to run optimized kernels of stylegan-2):

```
apt update
apt install -y curl ninja-build build-essential
```

Finally : 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

In order to run the accompanying scripts, you must define 2 environment variables :

`STYLEGAN_CODE_DIR` :  the location of your code, ending with `enriching_gan_ensembles` (the name of the repo).

`STYLEGAN_DATA_DIR` : the location of your data's _parent directory_ (e.g if your raw data samples are in `/disk/directory/enriching_data/data/`, then please provide `/disk/directory`).

# Running scripts

Scripts must be launched from the repo's main directory.

## Training
`bash scripts/run_training.sh $N_GPUs`
with $N_GPUs the number of graphic card you want to train on. This code has been tested with *single-node* training, larger scale training may encur communication overheads.
## Inversion
`bash scripts/run_inversion.sh`
## Perturbation tuning
`bash scripts/scale_tune.sh`
## Ensemble enriching
`bash scripts/generate_condition.sh`

# Data
## The AROME-EPS Dataset

The whole dataset comprises 516 AROME ensemble forecasts covering the period from June 15th, 2020, to November 12th, 2021. Each ensemble forecast is composed of 16 members and includes lead times at 1-hour intervals, ranging up to 45 hours. It follows that [516x45x16=371520]() individual samples are available for training if each members of the enseble at a given lead time is considered individually.

The data is restricted to a region encompassing the South-Eastern quarter of metropolitan France with a resolution of [256x256]. Three variables are here considered: the horizontal (u) and vertical (v) components of the wind speed vector at 10 meters and the temperature at 2 meters (t2m). Each individual sample can be conceptualized as a tensor with 3 channels, a width of 256 and a height of 256 [3, 256, 256]. Hourly precipitation rates (rr) are a 4th variable, which can be dealt with as an option (results are not validated for this latter variable).

To efficiently load and organize the dataset, a metadata CSV file is utilized. The file structure is illustrated below:

| Name          | Importance | PosX | PosY | Date       | LeadTime | Member |
